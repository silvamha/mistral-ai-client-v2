###Results of the previous project
The mistral-ai-client project after numerous attempt was corrupted and it is no longer possible to fix it since I no longer have access to the code

###Scope of Project
The project is to develop an application that connects to MistralAI, initially through the console/cli and later implement an interface

The tooling must include at the very minimum

<<
Vite
dotenv
BULMA
Saas
>>

<<<
You mentioned something about "Axios" when we were trying to set up the previous project but  I know nothing of it, so you will have to walk me through.

Please look closely at the project's requirement and walk me through tooling the application paying close attention to the logical order of instructions, creation of directories, placement of files, configuration of files
>>>

Please be aware that you are providing deprecated information about how to import BULMA. Make sure to give instructions to install the latest version of BULMA

Check, double check, and recheck or instructions for creation of directories, placement of files in directories, Vite configuration, package.JSON configuration.

There was an awful lot of back and forth in the last two projects and they were mostly done due to incorrect instructions on your part. Notice that this morning I was able to do a project in 45 minutes without your help, but it was a simpler project and yet very similar to a previous project you botched previously.

Please acknowledge understanding of the scope of the project and then walk me through tooling <<<ONE STEP AT A TIME>>> I do not want to deal with you streaming weeks worth of material in seconds. I want to proceed like this

You - Install xyz
Me - Done it works or it is doing such and such thing

You - Install abc
Me - Done! No problems

You - Configure file 123 like this ``` code code code ```. Run npm or whatever and tell me if there are any errors
Me - Done! I am getting a message that says blah! blah! blah!

That is how I want to work on this project from beginning to end, one step at a time 

Please acknowledge and let me know when you are ready to start
